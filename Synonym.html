        Synonyms are a valuable addition to any vocabulary. For those not familiar with the term, learning English as a second language, or who get a bit mixed up with the meaning of grammatical terms, the first step is to answer the question, "What is a synonym?" A synonym is a word with the same or nearly the same meaning as another.

        The value of synonyms becomes obvious when considering how a phrase or sentence sounds. If you were to describe every rugby player as big and angry then it would get boring by the 3rd team member. However, using words like "humongous, muscular, and buff" paired with "glowering, growling, and intimidating" wouldn't sound so repetitive and also conveys more information about the player. This is the second value of synonyms. Because some synonyms have slightly different meanings, using them can provide more depth or specificity to the situation. For example, if a person is running, they could be jogging casually or sprinting in fear. Using one of these synonyms to running conveys more information about the type of running without having to use more adverbs.</p>
